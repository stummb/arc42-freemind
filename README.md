For information about arc42, have a look at www.arc42.org

Some simple XSLT-Scripts to convert the confluence-export of arc42 to freemind-format.

You need to use the current RC (1.0.0-RC5) of freemind to open the generated mindmap.

To execute the XSLT, I used SaxonHE (see example.sh)

To make it work, unpack the confluence data to confluence/

When you open the mindmap, it expects the attachments directory of confluence besides
the mindmap file
